# Corpse Chest

**Version: 0.1.0

**Short description:**

Factorio mod to retain player inventory in a "corpse" after the player dies.

**Long description:**

Normally, when your character dies in Factorio, all of your inventory is lost. This mod spawns a chest at the location of your character (at the time of death) and fills it with whatever you had in your inventory. Currently only the main inventory and quick bar are supported. Also, items which have their own sub-inventory grid (such as armor) are not yet handled properly.

**Future plans:**

- Add proper support for armor (and similar items) so armor contents are also transferred.

# Corpse Chest

**Version: 0.1.5**

**Short description:**

Factorio mod to retain player inventory in a "corpse" after the player dies.

**Long description:**

Normally, when your character dies in Factorio, all of your inventory is lost. This mod spawns a container at the location of your character (at the time of death) and fills it with whatever you had in your inventory. All player inventories and all items are supported. Currently items in the player crafting queue are not transferred to the container upon death, they are simply lost.

**ToDo:**

- Add custom graphics.
- Make corpse disappear when empty. Alternatively, make corpse decay automatically over time.
- Add support for items in the craft queue.
